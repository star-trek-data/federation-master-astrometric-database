* 	**Denobula Triaxa (Iota Boötis) → Denobula Triaxa (i Boötis)**
	
	The mapmaker appears to have confused the stars [Iota Boötis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iota_Bo%C3%B6tis) and [i Boötis/44 Boötis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44_Bo%C3%B6tis), mistaking a lower case Latin _i_ for an abbreviation of the Greek *iota*. On the [STSRL:FHH]() map, this system is labeled as the former but appears at the location of the latter, with a ~50 LY difference between the two (Iota Boötis is farther spinward into the Alpha Quadrant than where it's placed on the map).
	
* 	**Kholfa → Khosla**
	
	A misspelling originating in the [Star Trek Encyclopedia]() and reappearing in [STSC](). Correct spelling sourced from the [DS9: "The Alternate"]() script and the [StarTrek.com article](http://www.startrek.com/database_article/khosla).
