* 	**Denobula Triaxa (Iota Boötis) → Denobula Triaxa (i Boötis)**
	
	The mapmaker appears to have confused the stars [Iota Boötis](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=iota%20Bootis&NbIdent=1&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcmin&submit=submit%20id) and [i Boötis/44 Boötis](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=44+Bootis), mistaking a lower case Latin _i_ for an abbreviation of the Greek *iota*. On the [STSRL:FHH]() map, this system is labeled as the former but appears at the location of the latter, with a ~50 LY difference between the two (Iota Boötis is farther spinward into the Alpha Quadrant than where it's placed on the map).

* 	**Kholfa → Khosla**
	
	A misspelling originating in the [Star Trek Encyclopedia]() and reappearing in [STSC](). Correct spelling sourced from the [DS9: "The Alternate"]() script and the [StarTrek.com article](http://www.startrek.com/database_article/khosla).
